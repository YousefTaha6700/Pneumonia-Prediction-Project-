# Pneumonia-Prediction-Project-
This project detects pneumonia using MobileNet, DenseNet, ResNet, EfficientNet, CondenseNet and GhostNet models. It preprocesses chest X-ray images, augments training data, and trains each model with K-Fold Cross-Validation. It uses a soft voting ensemble to average predictions from all models, improving accuracy, and evaluates the final results.
